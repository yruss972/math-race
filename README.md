#Math-Race
===========
Simple knockout.js / websockets / node.js real-time game

This is a **very simple real-time game** created with node.js, knockout.js and socket.io.

##Goal

Try to be faster than the other players in **solving simple mathematical equations**.

Every game has a limited time (defaults to one minute), so hurry up and beat the others.

Game score history is saved across games.

**No database required** (this is just a quick demo)

Enjoy!

##Installation

###Install dependencies with npm:

    npm install

###Configuration

Edit config file to reflect where are you running the server from (so the browser renders the proper link to socket.io resources)

```javascript
	exports.values={
		version: '0.0.1',
		server : {
			production : {
				real_time_server : {port: 8090, host: '127.0.0.1'}
			}
		}
		,
		game : {
			duration: 60 //seconds
		}
	}
```

Run the server

	node server.js 8090
